## Introduction
The STM32 family of microcontroller ICs is based on various 32-bit RISC ARM Cortex-M cores. STMicroelectronics licenses the ARM Processor IP from ARM Holdings and integrates it with custom-designed peripherals to create complete microcontroller solutions. Each STM32 microcontroller is designed for specific performance, power efficiency, and feature requirements, making them suitable for a wide range of embedded applications.
